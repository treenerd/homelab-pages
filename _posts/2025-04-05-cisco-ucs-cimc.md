title: "Reviving a Relic: Conquering the 2025 Cisco UCS Upgrade"

Fellow homelab adventurers, prepare for a tale of digital archaeology! I recently embarked on a mission to breathe new life into some older Cisco UCS bricks, and let me tell you, it was a journey through the labyrinthine corridors of legacy technology.

The primary hurdle?  Around 2013, Cisco decided to rely on Adobe Flash for the CIMC (IPMI) interface on UCS C220 servers.  Fast forward to 2025, and Flash is as extinct as the dodo, leaving us with a rather... interesting situation.  Trying to manage these systems without a functional CIMC is like trying to navigate a spaceship with a broken viewport.

But the Flash fiasco was just the appetizer.  The main course involved wrestling with the ancient Java version required to launch the KVM console.  Imagine trying to find a compatible Java runtime in a world dominated by modern JVMs – it was a time warp!

After a few hours of head-scratching, countless browser tweaks, and deep dives into the cryptic depths of the Cisco community forums, I finally cracked the code.  I managed to coax these venerable machines into accepting a shiny new 4.1x firmware upgrade.

It wasn't pretty, but it was victorious.  If you're facing a similar challenge, fear not!  I'm documenting the exact steps I took, the arcane rituals I performed, and the browser incantations that ultimately led to success. Stay tuned for the detailed walkthrough – you're not alone in this digital quest!

## What is Cisco CIMC?

The Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC) is a dedicated management processor embedded within Cisco UCS (Unified Computing System) servers.
* **Remote Server Management:**
    * Allows administrators to remotely monitor and manage Cisco UCS C-Series rack servers.
    * Provides control even when the operating system is down.
* **Out-of-Band Management:**
    * Operates independently of the server's main OS.
    * Crucial for:
        * Powering the server on/off.
        * Monitoring server health (temperature, fan speeds, etc.).
        * Updating firmware.
        * Accessing the server's console (KVM - Keyboard, Video, Mouse).
* **Key Functions:**
    * Provides web-based interface, CLI, and XML API.
    * Supports industry-standard protocols like IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface).
    * Offers low-level hardware control for data center management.

**In simpler terms:** CIMC is like a separate, always-on computer inside your server that lets you control the server's hardware remotely.

## CISCO HUU

Where to start the upgrade journey?  
Well let's check the related Release notes of the UCS Rack Server Software.  
In case of UCS C220 M4 the lates release at time of writing was [4.1(2)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/release/notes/b_release-notes-for-cisco-ucs-rack-server-software-release-4_1_2.html#reference_ikd_w5t_zjb) .

So in case of C220 M4 with CIMC version 2.0.2, the suggested upgrade path was 3.0(3a) to 4.1(2a) .  
The upgrades worked, but to install them was not as easy as expected.

## The challenge

How is it possible to access flash based web interfaces in 2025 to upgrade the CIMC.
Short answer, I tried, failed and discovered it is not needed at all for the upgrade.

### Just use a USB flash drive

My first thoughts where. Just use an USB stick, copy the ISO, plug it in and let the server boot into huu (the cisco upgrade tool).
Well, I recognized that it was not a common thing to use usb flash drives for this task back in 2013.
It seems Admins had to burn CD's and use CDROM drives to let the server boot into huu iso images, when it was not possible to access the out of band management.

Well, I had CDROM drives at the past. But in 2025? Nope not working anymore.

### Do I really need to access Flash?

Nope I do not have to access the Adobe Flash interface. There is a workaround, which I found in the Cisco Community Forum.
Just the JLNP file is needed to start the java web application.

```bash
https://<cimc_ip>/kvm.jnlp?cimcAddr=<cimc_ip>&tkn1=admin&tkn2=<password>

```
So far so good.
But now we need the java. Openjdk-8 and icedtea didn't work in my case.

#### Which java to use?

Can you remember, back in time when java has been available at [java.com](java.com)?
It is still available there! [Java downloads](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

```
cd ~/Downloads
sudo mkdir -p /opt/java/64
sudo tar xzvf ./jre-8u441-linux-x64.tar.gz /opt/java/64
sudo ln -s /opt/java/64/jre1.8.0_441 /opt/java/64/jre
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/opt/java/64/jre/bin/java" 1
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javaws" "javaws" "/opt/java/64/jre/bin/javaws" 1
sudo update-alternatives --set java /opt/java/64/jre/bin/java
sudo update-alternatives --set javaws /opt/java/64/jre/bin/javaws
```

Because of the outdated Certificates in CIMC we also have to think about a solution to overcome this obstacle.
One solution I tried was to set the system time of the VM back to 2018 ... and it worked.
After the first CIMC upgrade to version 3.x this won't be needed anymore, because then upgrades with USB Flash devices worked.
